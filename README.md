First Verstion : 
Can get all the districs of India by default entering the manual id value of state.
Goal:
Can Enter a state name and get the details of Districs.

Code:
Created the Navbar component and there I am taking the input from input field and set the state and at the end of the code I am calling my next Component CallRequest with props but Here is the main issue. I can not pass the inputed value as variable is not updating outside of the function.

Then I am calling my DistricList Component to fill the data and get show on the Screen.

How to resolve this issue?
